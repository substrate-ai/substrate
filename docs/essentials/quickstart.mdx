## Installation

To install SubstrateAI, run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
```bash python
pip install substrate-ai
```
</CodeGroup>

## Setup your account

After creating an account on our [website](https://substrateai.com), you need to login with our CLI tool. To do so, run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
```bash python
substrate-ai login
```
</CodeGroup>

## Setup your project
To link your current directory to your SubstrateAI account, run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
```bash python
substrate-ai init
```
</CodeGroup>

## Requirements

In order to run substrateAI, you need to have installed the Docker Engine. To install it, follow the instructions for your operating system:
    - [MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
    - [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
    - [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)

## Usage

To start running your code in the cloud with SubstrateAI, run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
```bash python
substrate-ai run
```
</CodeGroup>

## Project configuration

After doing `substrate-ai init`, you will have two new files in your directory:
    - **substrate.yaml** 
    - **requirements.txt**

You can edit these files to configure your project.

### substrate.yaml 

This allow you to configure the following attributes:
- **name**: The name of your project
- **hardware**: the type of hardware you want to use
- **main_file_location**: the location of your main file, to be use as python entry point

Here is an example of a substrate.yaml file:

```yaml
name: my-project
hardware:
  type: cpu
main_file_location: ./main.py
```

### requirements.txt

This is a standard requirements.txt file. This allow you to specify any package you want to install in your environment.
The specifcation can be found at the following link: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/

## Remarks

The job launched on SubstrateAI are not saved, thus any files are automatically deleted when a job is done. 
Thus we recommend to upload your trained model or data to a cloud service such as HuggingFace or AWS S3.
