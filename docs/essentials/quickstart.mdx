## Installation

To install SubstrateAI, run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
```bash python
pip install substrate-ai
```
</CodeGroup>

## Setup your account

After creating an account on our [website](https://substrateai.com), you need to login with our CLI tool. To do so, run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
```bash python
substrate-ai login
```
</CodeGroup>

## Setup your project
To link your current directory to your SubstrateAI account, run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
```bash python
substrate-ai init
```
</CodeGroup>

## Requirements

In order to run SubstrateAI, you need to have installed the Docker Engine. To install it, follow the instructions for your operating system:
    - [MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
    - [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
    - [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)

## Usage

To start running your code in the cloud with SubstrateAI, run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
```bash python
substrate-ai run
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
Running your project for the first time can take up to 30min to start, as we need to create your environment.
Subsequent job with this project will start in less than 2min.

This is a known issue and we are working on improving this.
</Warning>

## Project configuration

After doing `substrate-ai init`, you will have two new files in your directory:
    - **substrate.yaml** 
    - **requirements.txt**

You can edit these files to configure your project.

### substrate.yaml 

This allow you to configure the following attributes:
- **name**: The name of your project
- **hardware**: the type of hardware you want to use
- **main_file_location**: the location of your main file, to be use as python entry point

Here is an example of a substrate.yaml file:

```yaml
name: my-project
hardware:
  type: cpu
main_file_location: ./main.py
```

### requirements.txt

This is a standard requirements.txt file. This allow you to specify any package you want to install in your environment.
The specifcation can be found at the following link: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/

## Remarks

The jobs launched on SubstrateAI are not saved, therefore any files are automatically deleted when a job is done. 
We recommend that you upload your trained model or data to a cloud service such as HuggingFace or AWS S3.
